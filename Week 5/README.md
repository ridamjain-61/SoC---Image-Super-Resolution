## Week 5

Description: Getting started with Image Processing and Super Resolution

- Learn about Kernels
- Study the problem of Super Resolution
- Read about 3D CNNs
- Understand the [implementation](https://github.com/yjn870/srcnn-pytorch) of the paper on super resolution given below.

**Resources:**

- [Image Kernels](https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)
- [3D CNNs](https://towardsdatascience.com/step-by-step-implementation-3d-convolutional-neural-network-in-keras-12efbdd7b130)
- [Paper on Image Super Resolution](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00092v3)

**Note**:
- There is no implementation task this week. 
- You can also clear backlogs from the previous weeks if you have any.
- We will be proceeding towards the project in the upcoming weeks.
- You would be required to implement a bit more advanced paper(of your choice) on Super Resolution.
